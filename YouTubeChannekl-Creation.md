# 2) Create the YouTube account & baseline setup (step-by-step)

1. Create/choose a Google account you’ll use for the brand (create new if you want separation).
2. Visit YouTube → click your avatar → **Create a channel** → Choose “Use a custom name” → enter **Relvionix**.
3. Verify account by phone (required for longer uploads & features).
4. Enable 2FA on that Google account (security).
5. Switch to **YouTube Studio** to configure channel.

Important Studio settings:

* Channel > Customize > **Branding**:

  * Profile picture: logo (512×512 PNG)
  * Banner image: **2560×1440 px** (safe area: 1546×423 px). Keep core text/logo inside safe area.
  * Video watermark (optional): 150×150 PNG for subscribe button in player.

* Channel > Customize > **Basic info**:

  * Display name: Relvionix
  * Channel description (use the template below)
  * Links: add website (Notion/Carrd), Twitter/X, LinkedIn, GitHub (these show on banner)
  * Channel keywords: terraform, aws, devops, sre, infrastructure as code, observability

* Channel > Settings > **Channel**:

  * Country: (your location)
  * Advanced settings: allow embedding, set audience = “No, it’s not made for kids” (most developer content)

---

# 9) Content workflow (AI-powered, repeatable)

Use this repeatable workflow for each video:

1. Topic selection → validate demand (YouTube search, Reddit, Google Trends).
2. Outline (3–5 bullets): use ChatGPT prompt:

   ```
   Act as a DevOps instructor. Create a clear 7-step outline for a 10-minute YouTube tutorial titled "Terraform S3 Backend for AWS: Setup & Locking". Include introduction, steps, demo, and closing CTA.
   ```
3. Script generation (voice + on-screen text) with ChatGPT:

   ```
   Expand the outline into a conversational 8-minute script for voiceover. Keep sentences short, use active voice, include code snippets for Terraform, and mark [CUT TO SCREEN] where the demo will appear.
   ```
4. Record screen & voice (or use AI voiceover). If using AI voice (ElevenLabs), paste the script, choose voice, and render.
5. Edit (Descript/CapCut/Pictory). Add captions, highlight code blocks, add brand intro/outro.
6. Create thumbnail (Canva template) — use same layout for brand consistency.
7. Upload & optimize (title, description, tags, chapters).
8. Publish & promote: LinkedIn post, tweet, Dev.to article, Reddit (if allowed), and email to subscribers.

---

# 10) ChatGPT prompts you can copy-paste (high impact)

**Script prompt:**

```
You are an expert DevOps engineer. Write a conversational YouTube script (approx. 7 minutes) for the topic "Terraform S3 backend + DynamoDB locking on AWS". Use a friendly tone, add short code snippets, and include [CUT TO DEMO] notes. End with a CTA to subscribe and link to code.
```

**Description + timestamps prompt:**

```
Create a YouTube video description (300–400 words) for "Terraform S3 backend + DynamoDB locking on AWS". Include bullets for resources, timestamps for the major sections (Intro, S3, DynamoDB, Terraform config, Test, Wrap), and add a short CTA to subscribe.
```

**Thumbnail text variant prompt:**

```
Suggest 6 short thumbnail headlines (2–4 words) for a tutorial on Terraform remote state locking (S3 & DynamoDB). Make them punchy and attention-grabbing.
```

**Tags + keywords prompt:**

```
Generate 15 relevant YouTube tags for a video about Terraform remote state and DynamoDB locking on AWS that will maximize discoverability.
```

**Shorts repurpose prompt:**

```
Create 3 short (30–45 second) scripts from this 10-minute Terraform tutorial highlighting 'S3 backend setup', 'locking explanation', and 'common mistakes'. Each script should include a hook (first 5 seconds) and a CTA saying 'Watch full tutorial'.
```
